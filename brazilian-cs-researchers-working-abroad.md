# Brazilian Computer Science Researchers working abroad

I have created this list/repo to list the many Brazilians working abroad. It used to be only for Software Engineering professors but now it has expanded to other CS areas and to non-professors. To be on this list, the person must be a Brazilian working at an institution and doing research-related work.
